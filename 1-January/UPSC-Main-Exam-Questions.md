## UPSC MAINS – GS Paper I / II (Short model answers)

Q1. “Pakistan was created as a result of British policy rather than Indian acceptance.” Discuss. (10–12 marks)  
Answer (structure):
- Introduction: Thesis — partition resulted from a combination of communal politics and British decisions during withdrawal.
- Key points:
  - Colonial institutional measures (separate electorates, administrative divisions) increased communalism.
  - British desire for an orderly exit and to minimize responsibility for violence favoured partition options.
  - Failure of elite negotiations (Cabinet Mission) and escalating communal violence shifted British policy toward partition.
  - Role of League and Congress: League’s demand and Congress’s responses shaped choices, but final legal act was by British Parliament.
- Conclusion: British policy and the context of communal conflict together produced Pakistan; both external policy and internal politics were decisive.

Q2. Examine the role of the Muslim League in the partition of India. (10 marks)  
Answer (structure):
- Introduction: Muslim League as primary political engine for a separate Muslim homeland.
- Key points:
  - Articulated Two-Nation Theory and mobilized Muslim opinion across provinces.
  - Lahore Resolution (1940) consolidated the demand for separate states.
  - Electoral gains (1946) legitimized League’s claim to represent Muslim interests.
  - Use of mass mobilization and insistence on partition limited compromise space.
- Conclusion: Muslim League’s strategies and political legitimacy were central to making partition politically viable.

Q3. Why did the Cabinet Mission Plan fail? What were its consequences? (15 marks)  
Answer (structure):
- Introduction: Cabinet Mission aimed to reconcile unity with Muslim demands via grouping and limited centre.
- Reasons for failure:
  - Ambiguities and differing interpretations by Congress and League.
  - Congress unwilling to accept a weak centre; League feared Congress dominance.
  - Breakdown of trust and rapid escalation of communal tensions.
- Consequences:
  - Collapse of negotiations, Direct Action Day, widespread communal riots.
  - Strengthening of partition demand and paving way for Mountbatten Plan.
- Conclusion: The plan’s failure exposed political polarisation and accelerated the path to partition.

Q4. Assess Mahatma Gandhi’s role during the partition of India. (10 marks)  
Answer (structure):
- Introduction: Gandhi opposed partition morally and politically.
- Key points:
  - Advocated Hindu–Muslim unity and non-violence; undertook fasts and peace missions.
  - Tried to mediate between leaders but had limited political leverage over high-level negotiations.
  - Worked at grassroots to reduce communal violence and aid refugees.
- Conclusion: Gandhi remained a moral voice against partition; his efforts mitigated some violence but could not prevent the political outcome.
