## UPSC MAINS – GS Paper I / II

Q1. “Pakistan was created as a result of British policy rather than Indian acceptance.”
Discuss. (10–12 marks)
Model Answer
Introduction:
The creation of Pakistan in 1947 was the outcome of British colonial policies combined with communal politics in late colonial India.
Body:
The British followed a divide-and-rule policy, encouraging separate electorates and communal representation.
The Muslim League, under Jinnah, demanded Pakistan based on the Two-Nation Theory.
The Cabinet Mission Plan (1946) tried to keep India united but failed due to lack of consensus.
Increasing communal violence led the British to opt for a quick withdrawal.
The Mountbatten Plan and the Indian Independence Act, 1947, passed by the British Parliament, legally created Pakistan.
Conclusion:
Thus, Pakistan was not “given” by India but emerged due to British decisions during the transfer of power, accepted reluctantly by Indian leaders to avoid civil war.

Q2. Examine the role of the Muslim League in the partition of India. (10 marks)
Model Answer

Passed the Lahore Resolution (1940) demanding a separate Muslim state.
Rejected Congress dominance and feared marginalization of Muslims.
Organized Direct Action Day (1946), which escalated communal violence.
Refused to accept a strong centralized Indian union.
Conclusion:
The Muslim League’s uncompromising stance made partition inevitable, shaping the creation of Pakistan.
